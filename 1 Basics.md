Got it 👍. I’ll prepare a **clear and structured Python notes** covering:

* Introduction of Python
* Advantages and Disadvantages
* Basics (syntax & features)
* Input/Output functions
* Variables
* Data Types
* Type Casting

# 📘 Python Notes

## 1. Introduction to Python

* **Python** is a high-level, interpreted, and object-oriented programming language.
* Developed by **Guido van Rossum** in **1991**.
* Known for its **simplicity, readability, and versatility**.

🔹 **Key Features**:

* Easy to learn and use
* Open-source and free
* Interpreted (no need to compile)
* Portable (runs on Windows, Linux, Mac)
* Large standard library
* Supports Object-Oriented, Procedural, and Functional programming

---

## 2. Advantages of Python

✅ Easy to read and write (simple syntax like English).
✅ Extensive libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Django, Flask, TensorFlow, etc.).
✅ Cross-platform compatibility.
✅ Suitable for **AI, ML, Web Development, Data Science, Automation, etc.**
✅ Strong community support.

## 3. Disadvantages of Python

❌ Slower than C/C++ (because it’s interpreted).
❌ Higher memory usage.
❌ Not the best for **mobile app development**.
❌ Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) limits multi-threading performance.

## 4. Python Basics

* **Indentation** is used instead of `{}` or `;`.

```python
if 5 > 2:
    print("Five is greater than two")
```

* **Comments**:

```python
# This is a single-line comment
"""
This is
a multi-line
comment
"""
```

* **Case-sensitive**: `Variable`, `variable`, and `VARIABLE` are different.

---

## 5. Input / Output Functions

* **Output**:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
print("Sum is:", 10 + 5)
```

* **Input**:

```python
name = input("Enter your name: ")
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
print("Hello", name, "you are", age, "years old.")
```

---

## 6. Variables

* A **variable** is a container for data.
* No need to declare type explicitly.

```python
x = 10       # integer
name = "Ram" # string
pi = 3.14    # float
```

* **Multiple assignment**:

```python
a, b, c = 10, 20, 30
```

* **Constants**: By convention, written in uppercase.

```python
PI = 3.1416
```

## 7. Data Types in Python

### Basic Data Types:

* **Numeric Types**:

  * `int` → whole numbers
  * `float` → decimal numbers
  * `complex` → complex numbers (e.g., `2+3j`)

* **Text Type**:

  * `str` → strings

* **Sequence Types**:

  * `list` → ordered, mutable
  * `tuple` → ordered, immutable
  * `range` → sequence of numbers

* **Mapping Type**:

  * `dict` → key-value pairs

* **Set Types**:

  * `set` → unordered, unique items
  * `frozenset` → immutable set

* **Boolean Type**:

  * `bool` → `True` or `False`

* **Binary Types**:

  * `bytes`, `bytearray`, `memoryview`

---

## 8. Type Casting

* Converting one data type to another.

### Explicit Casting:

```python
x = int("10")      # string → int
y = float("5.5")   # string → float
z = str(123)       # int → string
```

### Implicit Casting:

* Done automatically by Python when safe.

```python
a = 10      # int
b = 2.5     # float
c = a + b   # result → float (12.5)
```

✅ This covers the **foundation of Python** for beginners.

Do you want me to also prepare **short MCQs + exercises with solutions** for these topics (for practice)?
